# WEATHER API

## **Overview:**
Playwright tool is used to test the REST API of the weather application.
APIRequestContext class is used - it allows the test to make API calls and create asserations for various asspects of the HTTP response.
Playwrightâ€™s built-in request function is used, which is an instance of APIRequestContext.

## **Benefit of this framework **
This Framework can be used for Frontend testing (UI) or/and API testing.
This framework can be handy in cases of:
    * Testing the server API
    * Prepareing server side state before visiting the web application in a test
    * Validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

## **Supported Browsers** (If we want to integrate the Weather api tests with UI tests)
1. Chrome - default browser
2. Firefox
3. MS Edge
4. WebKit - web browser engine used by Safari

## Test creation
- Create Test scenario with extension spec.ts.

### Execution
Running all tests
```sh
npx playwright test 
or

```

Running a single test file (example running weatherApi test)
```sh
